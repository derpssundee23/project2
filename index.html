        And a recent survey published earlier this month from the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF) found that 74% of Asian American and Pacific Islander

          Last week marked a year since a man murdered eight women — 
          six of them Asian American — at massage parlors across the metro Atlanta area.

          Despite all the political statements and impassioned pleas from victims, there was little meaningful change in how the justice system holds perpetrators accountable.
